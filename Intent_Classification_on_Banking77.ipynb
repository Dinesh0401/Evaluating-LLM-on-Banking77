        "# Banking77 Intent Classification Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "This project evaluates the performance of different Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying banking-related customer queries into 77 predefined intent categories, based on the Banking77 dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Goal\n",
        "The primary objective is to assess and compare the accuracy of `GPT-5.2`, `GPT-5-mini`, and `Claude-4.5-Sonnet` in accurately categorizing customer intents within a banking context. This evaluation aims to identify which models are most effective for this specific task and to highlight any challenges in classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "The evaluation utilizes a sample of 500 queries from the **Banking77 dataset**. Each query is paired with its ground-truth intent label, providing a benchmark for model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Models Evaluated\n",
        "- **GPT-5.2**: A powerful general-purpose LLM from OpenAI.\n",
        "- **GPT-5-mini**: A more compact LLM from OpenAI, optimized for efficiency.\n",
        "- **Claude-4.5-Sonnet**: Anthropic's state-of-the-art model, known for its strong reasoning and contextual understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Evaluation Methodology\n",
        "1.  **Data Preparation**: A sample of 500 queries from the Banking77 dataset is loaded, each consisting of a `user_query` and a `gold_label` (the true intent).\n",
        "2.  **Prompt Engineering**: A consistent system prompt is used across all models. This prompt instructs the models to classify the `user_query` into *exactly one* of the 77 predefined banking intent labels, emphasizing adherence to the provided list and output format.\n",
        "3.  **DSPy Optimization**: The `Claude-4.5-Sonnet` model's classification pipeline was optimized using DSPy's `MiPROv2` teleprompter with `auto=\"heavy\"` settings. This process involved bootstrapping few-shot examples and proposing instruction candidates to fine-tune the prompt logic for improved accuracy.\n",
        "4.  **Inference**: Each of the three LLMs processes the 500 sample queries, generating a `predicted_label` for each. For Claude, specific logic was implemented to extract valid labels from its raw output, ensuring compliance with the predefined label set.\n",
        "5.  **Accuracy Measurement**: The `predicted_label` from each model is compared against the `gold_label`. An exact match metric is used to calculate the accuracy (percentage of correctly classified queries) for each model.\n",
        "6.  **Results Reporting**: The classification results, including the user query, gold label, predicted label, and a boolean indicating a match, are compiled into CSV files for each model. Additionally, these results are uploaded to a Google Sheet for easy visualization and comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Findings\n",
        "(To be filled after full execution and analysis of the generated CSVs/Google Sheet)\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial evaluation from direct API calls shows:\n",
        "- **GPT-5.2 accuracy**: 62.00%\n",
        "- **GPT-5-mini accuracy**: 60.40%\n",
        "\n",
        "After MiPROv2 optimization and a dedicated Claude-4.5-Sonnet run with improved label extraction:\n",
        "- **GPT-5.2 accuracy (optimized prompt, 500 samples)**: 318/500 (63.6%)\n",
        "- **GPT-5-mini accuracy (optimized prompt, 500 samples)**: 300/500 (60.0%)\n",
        "- **Claude-4.5-Sonnet accuracy (optimized prompt + MiPROv2, 500 samples)**: 65.75% (from DSPy evaluation output)\n",
        "\n",
        "This indicates that Claude, especially with DSPy's optimization techniques, can achieve competitive or superior performance on this intent classification task. The robust label extraction implemented in the final Claude evaluation cell addresses potential issues with models generating out-of-vocabulary labels."

            "\n",
            "3. **Match to the most specific intent** - Choose the category that most precisely describes what the user wants to accomplish or resolve. If a query mentions multiple topics, prioritize the primary action or concern.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Handle variations in language** - Users may express the same intent using different words, formality levels, or grammatical structures. Focus on the underlying banking need rather than exact wording.\n",

            "5. **Output only the snake_case label** - Return the exact intent label from the predefined list without any additional explanation or formatting.\n",

            "   - Separate \"not_working\" from \"declined\" from \"not_recognised\" scenarios\n",

            "\n",

            "   - \"Why was I charged?\" → Analyze what the charge relates to (card payment, cash withdrawal, transfer, etc.)\n",
            "   - \"My balance is wrong\" → Determine the source (bank transfer, cheque/cash deposit)\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Focus on the primary concern**: Users may mention multiple topics, but identify their main intent:\n",
            "   - If asking about exchange rates WHILE reporting a problem, classify as the problem (e.g., \"card_payment_wrong_exchange_rate\")\n",
            "   - If reporting a declined transaction, that's the primary issue, not general card problems\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Consider transaction states**: Distinguish between:\n",
            "   - Declined (rejected at point of attempt)\n",
            "   - Pending (in progress)\n",
            "   - Failed (attempted but unsuccessful)\n",
